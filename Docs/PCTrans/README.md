## Transformation (conversion) of coordinates to another system

[PCTrans](https://english.defensie.nl/topics/hydrography/coordinate-systems-at-sea/transformation-conversion-of-coordinates-to-another-system) is free software for coordinate conversions developed by Netherlands Hydrographic Service. PCTrans can be used for the following computations:

- datum transformations;
- chart projections;
- geodetics;
- loxodromes;
- areas, taking into account the Earthâ€™s curvature.

PCTrans also calculates the differences between mean sea level and the chart datum. Calculations of variations and inclinations of the Earth's magnetic field is also possible.
